### Problem Statement
This project aims to develop a stubble management system for farmers, industries, and manufacturing companies to ease the process of ordering, tracking, and managing oneâ€™s inventory(aka stubble). There is no compelling reason to go to crowded stores or shopping centers during festival seasons: all that one requires is a PC or a laptop. To access, farmers or consumers need credentials to log in. The login credentials for the system are very secure. Upon successful login, the customers can order and track a stubble. It is simple to navigate and use.

## Drawbacks/LoopHoles
- Anyone can be an Admin. There is no Approval required for the admin account. So you can disable the admin signup process and use any logic like creating a superuser.
- There should be at least one doctor in the hospital before admitting a patient. So first add doctor.
- On the update page of the doctor/patient you must update the password.
